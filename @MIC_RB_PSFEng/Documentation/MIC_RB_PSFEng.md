MIC_RB_PSFEng is a SuperResolution data collection software.
MIC_RB_PSFEng Explore and design PSFs on the Reflected Beam
Microscope and other PSF engineering setups. This class is designed
to interface with various hardware
components like SLM, cameras, lasers, and piezos to enable the
exploration and design of PSFs.
It includes methods for constructing the PSF, calibrating the pupil position,
and other utilities that aid in PSF engineering.
