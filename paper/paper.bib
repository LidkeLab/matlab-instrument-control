    abstract = {Sequential labeling and imaging in fluorescence microscopy allows the imaging of multiple structures in the same cell using a single fluorophore species. In super-resolution applications, the optimal dye suited to the method can be chosen, the optical setup can be simpler and there are no chromatic aberrations between images of different structures. We describe a method based on DNA strand displacement that can be used to quickly and easily perform the labeling and removal of the fluorophores during each sequence. Site-specific tags are conjugated with unique and orthogonal single stranded DNA. Labeling for a particular structure is achieved by hybridization of antibody-bound DNA with a complimentary dye-labeled strand. After imaging, the dye is removed using toehold-mediated strand displacement, in which an invader strand competes off the dye-labeled strand than can be subsequently washed away. Labeling and removal of each DNA-species requires only a few minutes. We demonstrate the concept using sequential dSTORM super-resolution for multiplex imaging of subcellular structures.}

abstract = {Summary
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase with important roles in many cellular processes as well as in cancer and other diseases. EGF binding promotes EGFR dimerization and autophosphorylation through interactions that are well understood structurally. How these dimers relate to higher-order EGFR oligomers seen in cell membranes, however, remains unclear. Here, we used single-particle tracking (SPT) and Förster resonance energy transfer imaging to examine how each domain of EGFR contributes to receptor oligomerization and the rate of receptor diffusion in the cell membrane. Although the extracellular region of EGFR is sufficient to drive receptor dimerization, we find that the EGF-induced EGFR slowdown seen by SPT requires higher-order oligomerization—mediated in part by the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain when it adopts an active conformation. Our data thus provide important insight into the interactions required for higher-order EGFR assemblies involved in EGF signaling.}

    abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy super-resolution methods rely on stochastic blinking/binding events, which often occur multiple times from each emitter over the course of data acquisition. Typically, the blinking/binding events from each emitter are treated as independent events, without an attempt to assign them to a particular emitter. Here, we describe a Bayesian method of inferring the positions of the tagged molecules by exploring the possible grouping and combination of localizations from multiple blinking/binding events. The results are position estimates of the tagged molecules that have improved localization precision and facilitate nanoscale structural insights. The Bayesian framework uses the localization precisions to learn the statistical distribution of the number of blinking/binding events per emitter and infer the number and position of emitters. We demonstrate the method on a range of synthetic data with various emitter densities, DNA origami constructs and biological structures using DNA-PAINT and dSTORM data. We show that under some experimental conditions it is possible to achieve sub-nanometer precision.}
